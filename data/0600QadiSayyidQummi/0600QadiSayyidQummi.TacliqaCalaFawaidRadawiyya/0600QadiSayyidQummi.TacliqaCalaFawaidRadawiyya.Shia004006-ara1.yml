90#VERS#COMMENT##: The URI is wrong. This is a commentary upon commentary, namely a tacliqa by Imam Ruhollah Khomeini on another hadith commentary by
 Qadi Sacid Qummi (d. 1107). The text of the original and the commentary is given together, in hashiya style on one page. 
 For stylistic and other analysis the text should be broken down and split into original and commentary. In order to make it easier, I have marked the beginning of the quotations as level three subheadings.
